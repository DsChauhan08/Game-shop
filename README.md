# Game-Shop

A one place stop for Web games and Ideas. 

## Description

Many of the games in our repository are open-source projects, 
meaning you can not only play them but also contribute to their development.
Whether you're an experienced coder looking to collaborate or a newcomer eager to learn, these open-source games provide an excellent opportunity to get involved in the world of game development.

This is my way in learning the 3d libraries aswell as the og side of javascript and learning it while reading and modifying others program.
